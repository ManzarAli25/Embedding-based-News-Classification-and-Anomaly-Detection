Methodology and Intuition:
In this project, we used vector embeddings and K-means clustering to classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content. 
The main goal of this approach is to leverage the powerful capabilities of embedding models for understanding semantic relationships in text and then apply unsupervised learning (K-means) 
to group similar articles together.

1. Vector Embeddings: Converting Text to Numerical Representation
To begin the analysis, the textual data (news articles, titles, or other content) is transformed into a high-dimensional vector representation using embedding models.
Embedding models are trained to capture semantic meanings of words, sentences, or documents. Here, we first generated the vector embeddings and then reduced the dimensions of it for visualization purposes.
The intuition behind embeddings is that words or phrases with similar meanings are represented by vectors that are close to each other in vector space. 
For example, the words "real" and "genuine" would be close together in the vector space, while "real" and "fake" would be further apart. 
This transformation makes it easier to identify patterns or relationships within the text using machine learning techniques.

2. K-means Clustering: Grouping Texts Based on Similarity
After transforming the news articles into vector embeddings, we used K-means clustering,
a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group similar data points (news articles) into clusters.
Here, we selected 2 clusters based on the assumption that we want to distinguish between two main categories—real and fake news.

4. Intuition and Visualization:
By projecting the vector embeddings into a two-dimensional space using techniques like t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), 
we can visually observe how the articles group together. t-SNE helps reduce the dimensionality of the embedding vectors while preserving the local structure, making it easier to interpret the results.
Real news articles are expected to cluster together in the vector space due to their similar linguistic patterns and structure.
Fake news articles, which often have different characteristics (e.g., sensationalism, misleading headlines, etc.), will form a separate cluster.
The boundaries between the clusters can provide insights into how distinct the real and fake news articles are, based on their textual features.
Additionally, this clustering can help in anomaly detection. 
Articles that don't fit well into the real or fake clusters might be considered outliers, suggesting that they do not conform to the typical structure or pattern seen in real or fake news.

Applications:
Real vs. Fake News Classification: The primary application of this method is to classify news articles as real or fake by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques.
Outlier/Anomaly Detection: Beyond classification, this method can also be used for detecting outliers—articles that don’t fit well into either cluster. 
These could represent misclassified data, highly biased sources, or articles that don't follow typical patterns.
Textual Pattern Recognition: Embedding models are excellent at recognizing latent patterns in textual data. 
This could be expanded to other use cases, such as detecting specific topics, sentiment, or even misinformation trends.
